# Flicker Image Gallery
Assignment submission by Siddharth Paneri.

## Assignment details:
Build a simple image gallery application, using publicly available API. The application should support the scenarios below.
Please come up with your own UI & UX keeping in mind that this shouldnâ€™t be the main focus in this task.

#### Gallery
User should be able to see images from Flickr. Please use this url:
```
https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public
```
Image metadata should be visible for each picture. Please note that images should be cached.

#### Ordering
User should be able to order images by date taken or date published

#### Search
Search box should appear at the top of image list. It should filter images by tag.

#### Error handling
In case of HTTP connnection error please display Modal dialog with erorr information.

#### Technologies
Application should be written using Java/Kotlin/Swift. Application should be tested.
Limit your usage of 3rd party libraries only to the few ones that add a large benefit to the architecture and testability of the project.
Good example of libraries that could be used are RxSwift, RxJava etc.
